@*
  views use "Razor syntax" which is HTML + some extra stuff
  this is a comment
*@

@{ 
    // this is a Razor block (a block of C# statements which runs when the view is being rendered to HTML)
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

the model is: @Model

@*
  that is a Razor expression - the @ switches to "C# mode"
  so it'll look for a property named Model that's in scope, convert it to a string, and put it into the HTML.
