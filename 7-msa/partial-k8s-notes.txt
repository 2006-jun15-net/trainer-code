k8s
    cluster
        a set of machines (nodes) that kubernetes runs containers on.
    node
        a machine in a cluster (a VM or a physical server)
    namespace
        clusters can be divided into different namespaces if needed.
        usually we stick to the default one.
    cluster master
        every cluster needs at least one master node.
        the master nodes manage the other (worker) nodes.
        with kubectl, we tell the master what to do, and it tells the workers what to do.
    pod
        a pod is the building block of kubernetes. an abstraction over one container.
        technically it could contain several containers but usually just one.
        pods can be given resource limits - how much CPU/memory they need,
        how much they are allowed to request at max.
        goes through states: pending, running; succeeded, failed.
    deployment
        an abstraction over pods. rather than managing each pod by hand,
        we define a desired amount of pods (replicas), and let k8s make them for us
        and distribute them automatically across the nodes. each replica (pod) will
        be an instance of the same image.
        deployments can be updated and rolled back without having to turn everything
        off and on again.
