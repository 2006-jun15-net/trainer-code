    //   but i have several ways to do it, might need to switch between them.

    // interfaces let us decouple code that needs functionality
    // from code that provides functionality.

    // e.g. methods in the Program class might accept a ISortingAlgorithm
    // parameter. i could pass into those methods an instance of any class
    // that implements that interface.
